# Lab 3 - Questa Simulation & Test Bench

## Repository Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files and resources related to Lab 3 on Questa simulation and test bench for combinational circuits. The lab involves simulating circuits and verifying their correctness using test benches.

## Folder Structure
- **adder/**: Contains the RTL code and test bench for the adder circuit.
- **lab2_tb/**: Holds the RTL code and test bench for the circuit implemented in Lab 2.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the `adder/` folder to access the RTL code and test bench for the adder circuit.
2. Use the `lab2_tb/` folder to find the RTL code and test bench for the circuit from Lab 2.
3. Run the test benches using QuestaSim to verify circuit functionality.
4. Analyze simulation waveforms and results for validation.
