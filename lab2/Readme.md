# Lab 2 - Combinational Circuits

## Repository Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files and resources related to Lab 2 on combinational circuits. The lab involves designing, implementing, and testing combinational circuits using RTL code and FPGA constraints.

## Folder Structure
- **rtl/**: Contains the RTL (Register Transfer Level) code for the combinational circuit.
- **constraint/**: Holds the constraint files required for FPGA implementation.
- **bit/**: Includes the `.bit` file for FPGA programming.
- **draw.io/**: Contains the circuit diagrams created using draw.io.
- **manual/**: Provides the lab tasks and manual documentation.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the `rtl/` folder to access the Verilog/VHDL code.
2. Use the `constraint/` files for FPGA pin mapping and constraints.
3. Program the FPGA using the `.bit` file from the `bit/` folder.
4. Refer to `draw.io/` for circuit diagrams.
5. Follow the lab instructions in `manual/` for step-by-step guidance.
